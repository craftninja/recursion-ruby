# Intro to Recursion

## Background

Recursion is a technique where a method can call itself.  Recursion can be used to traverse tree structures.  
For example, take the following tree, where each letter represents a node in the tree:

```
          A
      ____|____
      |       |
      B       C
    __|__   __|__
    |   |   |   |
    D   E   F   G
                |
                H

```

In this tree, we can say that

* `A` is the "root" node
* `A` has two child nodes: `[B, C]`
* `B` has two child nodes: `[D, E]`
* `C` has two child nodes: `[F, G]`
* `G` has one child node:  `[H]`

Let's say you wanted to go over the entire tree and print the letters out, you could write code like this: 

```ruby
puts root.letter                                      # prints "A"
root.child_nodes.each do |child_node_1|               # goes over ["B", "C"]
  puts child_node_1.name
  child_node_1.child_nodes.each do |child_node_2|     # goes over ["D", "E"], then ["F", "G"]
    puts child_node_2.name
    child_node_2.child_nodes.each do |child_node_3|   # goes over ["H"]
      puts child_node_3.name
    end
  end
end
```

You can see that this only works if the tree has 4 levels.  But what if it had 8, or 100 levels?  Basically that code
is doing the same thing, but from a different starting point:

1. Start with `A`, print `A`'s letter
1. Go over all of `A`'s children and repeat step 1, but start with `B`, then with `C`

We could write that in Ruby like so:

```ruby
def print_letters(node)
  puts node.name
  node.child_nodes.each do |child_node|
    print_letters(child_node)
  end
end
```

## Challenge

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make `tree_spec.rb` pass.

# Setup

* Fork
* Clone
* Turn on TravisCI for the fork by
  visiting https://travis-ci.org/profile/<github user name>, clicking the "Sync now" button
  and scrolling down to find the repository to build.
* Create a new branch for your work using `git checkout -b v1`
* Implement specs and code
* Push using `git push -u origin v1`

## Further Practice

This warmup can be completed multiple times to increase your comfort level with the material.
To work on this from scratch, you can:

1. Add an upstream remote that points to the original repo `git remote add upstream git@github.com:gSchool/THIS-REPO.git`
1. Fetch the latest from the upstream remote using `git fetch upstream`
1. Create a new branch from the master branch of the upstream remote `git checkout -b v2 upstream/master`
1. Implement specs and code
1. Push using `git push -u origin v2`

Each time you do the exercise, create a new branch. For example the 3rd time you do the exercise the branch
name will be v3 instead of v2.
